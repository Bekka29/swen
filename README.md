# Software Engineering - From REPL to SYSTEM

## Readings and Resources:

- THEORY: Basics of Computation: https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/th-deggendorf/reader.action?docID=6640815
- PRACTICE: Basic Python: https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/th-deggendorf/reader.action?docID=6797218
- EXERCISES: https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/98897122-22s_swen

## Agenda

- 20-30min  | Brief theoretical input on basic topics of automation and computation.
- 60-90min | Practical Exercises and Coding Examples with Python
- 60-90min | Review and joint development of selected Homework Exercises

## Deliverables (ungraded)

For each session there are a set of exercises listed here on GitHub Classroom: https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/98897122-22s_swen

We will do the first batch of exercises for Session 1 together. From Sesssion 2 onwards you are encouraged to prepare all exercises associated to a certrain session. I will provide feedback and guidance on the side. For each session, I will pick some difficult or important exercises and discuss solutions with the class.

## Exam (graded)

The Exam will be written and online. It will ask about theory and require you to work on several coding exercise.


## Sessions

### 1 - The Urge to Compute and Automate  

#### Theory: How do we compute and automate and why?
- What would you like to automate?

- What do you think about DAOs?
 
    The ideal of a decentralized autonomous organization is easy to describe: it is an entity that lives on the internet and exists autonomously, but also heavily relies on hiring individuals to perform certain tasks that the automaton itself cannot do.
