# 22S - Software Development

## Session 1

### Class Content


#### Theory:

- Glanced over the way binary data is encoded
- Introduced the reasons for Computation and Automation
- Introduced the many levels of Abstraction from Logic Gates, Register Management (Assembler), Memory Management (C), Interpreted Languages (Python)


#### Practice: 

- Introduced Python hands-on


#### Exercise:

- Worked on two code exercises to onboard students on Github Classroom


### ToDo:

- Provide Tutorial for installing Python 3 (incl. pip and pytest)
- Provide Tutorial for using Github Classroom with several Editors (Vim, VScode, Pycharm)


### Minimum Achievement:

- Understand Github Classroom (Clone, Commit, Push)
- Have an Editor Set-up and know how to use it
- Have committed two exercises with fully or partially working code
- Be able to explain own issues around the tools or the programming exercises


## Session 2

- Peer Learning Session to board everybody onto Github Classroom {pass: 7, on: 20, total: 32}
- Introduction to Types in Python


### Class Content:


#### Numbers

- Binary (0,1 | True,False)
- Int (42)
- Float (42.23)


#### Immutable Sequences

- String `"Olivia"`
- Tuple  `("Dominik", 42)`


#### Mutable Sequences

- List `["Marina", "Marina", "Johnson", "Madalina", "Kizito", "Sharima"]`
- Set `{1,2,3,4,5}`
- Dict 

``` python
{'name': 'Marina',
 'age': '42',
 'students': ['Marina', 'Marina', 'Johnson', 'Madalina', 'Kizito', 'Sharima']}
```


### ToDo:

- Focus more on Mutable Sequences (esp. Dict was very short)
- Data Types not discussed (Date, collections, Enum)
- Very brief on choosing data types (Focus next session)


### Minumum Achievement

- Have at least 4 Exercises submitted
