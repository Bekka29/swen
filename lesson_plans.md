### Class Goals

- Learn clean coding in python
- Understand abstraction
- Find a direction for personal projects


### Class Implementation (LISTEN - REPEAT - UNDERSTAND)

- Lecture (Very Brief Theory and Showcasing)
- Practice (Interactive Hands-on Exercises)
- Exercises (Small coding challenges to implement concepts)

### Literature and Reading

- Literature provides and addon to the concepts dicussed in class. Read when triggered by a lack of understanding or when trying to solve a specific problem. 
- Focus is on Code Exercises
